# User Centric Front-End Development
## Context
To build a static front-end site of at least 3 pages for a *clothing brand* using HTML and CSS to include/be:

- Sufficient information about the brand and the buying process
- Products with relavant description and details
- Any other information that is crucial to the shopper (e.g. shop policies)
- High resolution media (images and videos)
- User-friendly

**External User's Goal:** Purchase fashionable clothing from the brand.

**Site Owner's Goal:** Sell and present information about the brand and its products so that shoppers can make an informed decision when purchasing from the brand.

## Strategy and Scope
### Strategy
#### Identifying External Users
- The brand offers affordable mid-range contemporary fashion for young women from 18 to 35 years old who may be studying or working. 
- This group women enjoy posting and browsing social media on their phones to keep up with the latest happenings.
- Therefore, the site has to be mobile-friendly and have a design that is modern.

#### Identifying External User's Goals
- The main purpose for the external user to visit the site is to learn about the brand and shop the listings. 
- After finding out the necessary information for them to make an informed decision, they will then decide whether to purchase from the brand or buy from somewhere else.

EU1. Find out whether the brand's values and theirs are aligned.
EU2. Browse through the shop's offerings to determine if the products are to their liking.
EU3. Compare prices with similar shops.

SO4. Information about the brand and its products.
SO5. Quick loading times.
