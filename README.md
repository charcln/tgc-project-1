## Strategy and Scope
### Strategy
#### Identifying External Users
- The brand offers affordable mid-range contemporary fashion for young women from 18 to 35 years old who may be studying or working. 
- This group women enjoy posting and browsing social media on their phones to keep up with the latest happenings.
- Therefore, the site has to be mobile-friendly and have a design that is modern.

#### Identifying External User's Goals
- The main purpose for the external user to visit the site is to learn about the brand and shop the listings. 
- After finding out the necessary information for them to make an informed decision, they will then decide whether to purchase from the brand or buy from somewhere else.

```
EU1. Find out whether the brand's values and theirs are aligned.
EU2. Browse through the shop's offerings to determine if the products are to their liking.
EU3. Compare prices with similar shops.
EU4. Check whether the shop is based in their area and how long it takes to receive their order.
EU5. Read shop policies before (Shipping) or after (Exchange/Return/Refund) purchase.
EU6. Check whether their favored items are in-stock and available in their size.
```
A single shop may have hundreds of products for a user to browse through. This can be overwhelming. Therefore, data should be displayed in a detailed and concise (short-and-sweet) manner to prevent that from happening.

#### Identifying Site Owner's Goals
The main purpose for the site owner is to provide information about the brand and its products to shoppers to make a sale. The site should include/be:
```
SO1. Adaptable to different screen sizes.
SO2. Modern and attractive design.
SO3. Easy to use.
SO4. Information about the brand and its products.
SO5. Quick loading times.
SO6. Reviews and social proof.
```
